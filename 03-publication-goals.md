# Publication Goals

Based on the findings and conversations around the December 2015 publication workshop, these are the four primary, overarching goals we will focus on for the development of the publication. Further user interviews and early prototypes will also be pursued to validate these ideas.

## Activate

*What activates the object?*

- Movement, animation
- Sound
- Storytelling, listening to someone speak about it, anecdotes
- Stories about the people around it
- 3D, objectness
- Allow it to be *used*
- Show it in multiple realizations

## Connect

*How, and to what, do we connect the scores?*

- through artists and performers
- through their public reception and history
- inter-disciplinary connects
- to other sources, bibliography, websites
- connect object intros and interpretive materials directly to the scores themselves.

## Materialize

*What does it mean to materialize the publication?*

- consider the "objectness" of the publication
- produce a physical version: print or even a file on a drive
- design for actual, material, physical use in the classroom
- incorporate physical (aural, bodily) performance

## Legitimize

*How to we legitimize this avant-garde work and the digital publication format?*

- Get the history right first
- Make the design clear, clean, classic, smart
- Cross references, glossaries across disciplines
- Make it citable
- Make the scholarly argument clear
